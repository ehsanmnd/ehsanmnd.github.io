Hi dear vistors! My name is Ehsan Maminejad, and welcome to my website! 


> For a comprehensive description of me in Farsi, you can read [here](/about/fa).


I am trying to be an observer and a problem solver in this world full of challenges and opportunities.  
I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and used creatively**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit. But, there is still a long way to go,
and this site records my progress in life and career.

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on data science, software
development, machine learning, and research. I hope you'll enjoy your time here,
so grab yourself a coffee and feel free to look around!
