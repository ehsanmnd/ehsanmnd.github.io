<span class="firstcharacter">H</span>ey there, data enthusiasts and curious minds! I'm Ehsan Maminejad.
Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where we'll explore the vast, exciting world of data science, machine learning, and related topics. 
But it will not be just for tech, it will also be about life!



## Why "Hello World!"?

As any coder knows, "Hello World!" is the traditional first step in learning a new programming language.
Consider this blog post my "Hello World!" to youâ€”the start of what I hope will be an exciting journey of learning,
sharing, and growing together in data science and what is related to life.


## Why "Owl"?
In Greek mythology, Athena, the goddess of wisdom, chose the owl as her sacred animal,
associating it with her keen intelligence and strategic prowess.
The owl became a symbol of wisdom, representing the ability to see beyond the surface and discern truth in the shadows[^1].
By this definition, in my opinion, the owl would be a fitting symbol for a data scientist, someone who works with data to gain wisdom or solve a problem!


## Who Am I?

I'm a data scientist and ML engineer with a passion for designing and implementing AI/ML systems.
I've had the privilege of working on some pretty cool projects.
From building customer data platforms for B2B businesses to developing social commerce search engines,
I've seen firsthand how data can transform businesses and industries.

Also, I am interested in mountain climbing, cooking, reading books and music.

But enough about my resume (you can check that out on my [About page(en)](/about/en) or [About page(fa)](/about/fa)if you're really curious). What I'm really excited about is sharing what I've learned along the way and learning from you too!

## What's This Blog All About?

Think of this blog as a melting pot of data science goodness. Here's what you can expect:

My Blog will consist of four main parts:
- Life: A space for personal experiences, reflections, and day-to-day thoughts.
- Projects: Detailed documentation of personal and professional projects.
- Research: Deep dives into specific topics and academic interests.
- Notebook: Quick notes, ideas, and learning materials that I hope helps you as much as it has helped me. 

I would like to mention that I am attempting to post in both English and Farsi.


## Let's Kick Off This Data Adventure!

I'm excited to start this adventure with you. Here's how you can get involved:

- Questions? Feel free to ask anything in the comments. Remember, in data science, there are no dumb questions!

- Suggestions for topics you want to see discussed? I'm open to all ideas!

- Interested in collaborating on a project or contributing to a post? Reach out, and let's discuss!

Ehsan
